# Unity.HTTP_Server
> A simple C# HTTP server implementation for Unity

This project is based on `@sableangle`'s [UnityHTTPServer][], but the original
repository lacks a license and seems to be unmaintained. The aim of this project
is to adapt and extend the existing code, making it distinct from the original,
and release it under a valid open-source license.

Key improvements over the original:

- Enhanced control over `MonoBehaviour`
- Support for multiple instances
- Packaged for easy deployment
- Handle routing
